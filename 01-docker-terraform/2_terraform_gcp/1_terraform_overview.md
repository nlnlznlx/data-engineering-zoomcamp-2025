### Concepts

#### Introduction

1. What is [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io)?
   * open-source tool by [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com), used for provisioning infrastructure resources
   * supports DevOps best practices for change management
   * Managing configuration files in source control to maintain an ideal provisioning state 
     for testing and production environments
2. What is IaC?
   * Infrastructure-as-Code
   * build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way 
     by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share.
3. Some advantages
   * Infrastructure lifecycle management
   * Version control commits
   * Very useful for stack-based deployments, and with cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, Azure, K8Sâ€¦
   * State-based approach to track resource changes throughout deployments


#### Files

* `main.tf`
* `variables.tf`
* `.tfstate`
* Optional: `resources.tf`, `output.tf`

Example: `resources.tf`
```bash
resource "google_storage_bucket" "example_bucket" {
  name          = var.bucket_name
  location      = var.region
  force_destroy = true

  lifecycle_rule {
    condition {
      age = 30
    }
    action {
      type = "Delete"
    }
  }
}

resource "google_compute_instance" "example_instance" {
  name         = "example-instance"
  machine_type = "n1-standard-1"
  zone         = var.zone

  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = "debian-cloud/debian-11"
    }
  }

  network_interface {
    network = "default"
  }
}
```

Example: `output.tf` - A file to define **output values** that display important information about your infrastructure after applying the configuration.
```bash
output "bucket_name" {
  description = "The name of the created bucket"
  value       = google_storage_bucket.example_bucket.name
}

output "instance_ip" {
  description = "The public IP of the compute instance"
  value       = google_compute_instance.example_instance.network_interface[0].access_config[0].nat_ip
}

output "project_id" {
  description = "The project ID used for deployment"
  value       = var.project_id
}
```

#### Declarations
* `terraform`: configure basic Terraform settings to provision your infrastructure
   * `required_version`: minimum Terraform version to apply to your configuration
   * `backend`: stores Terraform's "state" snapshots, to map real-world resources to your configuration.
      * `local`: stores state file locally as `terraform.tfstate`
   * `required_providers`: specifies the providers required by the current module
* `provider`:
   * adds a set of resource types and/or data sources that Terraform can manage
   * The Terraform Registry is the main directory of publicly available providers from most major infrastructure platforms.
* `resource`
  * blocks to define components of your infrastructure
  * Project modules/resources: `google_storage_bucket`, `google_bigquery_dataset`, `google_bigquery_table`
* `variable` & `locals`
  * runtime arguments and constants


#### Execution steps
1. `terraform init`: 
    * Initializes & configures the backend, installs plugins/providers, & checks out an existing configuration from a version control 
2. `terraform plan`:
    * Matches/previews local changes against a remote state, and proposes an Execution Plan.
3. `terraform apply`: 
    * Asks for approval to the proposed plan, and applies changes to cloud
4. `terraform destroy`
    * Removes your stack from the Cloud
